# clockwork
<h3>What is in this repository</h3>
    <p>This repository consists of the “Clockwork” project, my attempt at creating an interactive scheduling tool projected over
        a circular clock face. The clockwork html and js files were my first push at the project. However, I continued work in the
        clockimage line of files upon the integration of an image into the UI.</p>

    <h3>State of the project?</h3>
    <p>Incomplete as of now.</p>

    <h3>Compatibility and testing</h3>
    <p>The application has only been tested on the firefox web browser (as that is where it was and is being developed) and is known
        to have issues on chrome and probably other browsers.</p>
